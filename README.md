# Autonomous Drone
* As a part of [Flipkart grid 4.0 challenge 2023](https://unstop.com/competition/flipkart-grid-40-robotics-challenge-in-association-with-shaastra-iit-madras-shaastra-2023-indian-institute-o-431848), I along with a team of 8 people worked on building autonomous drone.
* We used dronekit and pymavlink packages to make the drone autonomous.
* Read through the documentation of [Dronekit](https://dronekit-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/guided-set-speed-yaw-demo.html#example-guided-mode-send-global-velocity) to know the functions used in autonomous flight.
